End-to-end machine learning project to **understand, quantify, and predict customer churn** in telecom and other subscription-based businesses such as banking and SaaS.

This project focuses on predictive performance, imbalance handling, business cost , and decision threshold calibration for real retention campaigns.

---

## 1. Business Context

Customer churn is one of the most expensive revenue leaks in  businesses. Acquiring a new customer often costs significantly more than retaining an existing one.

**Executive Problem**

> “We are losing every month. We do not clearly know who will leave next, nor which segments are most vulnerable.”

### Objective

Develop a predictive system that:

- Identifies customers likely to churn in the next 30 days  
- Optimizes recall while controlling campaign cost  
- Enables targeted retention campaigns  
- Produces interpretable churn drivers  

The goal is business impact, not just model accuracy.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Key observations:

- Month-to-month contracts churn 3–4× more than long-term contracts  
- High monthly charges + low tenure represent highest-risk segment  
- Customers without OnlineSecurity or TechSupport show elevated churn  
- Electronic check payment correlates with churn  
- Senior citizens have slightly higher churn probability  

Dataset imbalance: ~27% churn.

Implications:

- Stratified cross-validation required  
- PR-AUC prioritized over ROC-AUC  
- Recall-based threshold optimization  

---

## 4. Feature Engineering

Enhancements applied:

- Tenure buckets (0–6, 6–12, 12–24, 24+ months)  
- Revenue-to-tenure ratio  
- Service count aggregation  
- Binary encoding for contract type  
- Interaction term: tenure × monthly charges  
- Log transform of skewed monetary variables  

Final feature space: 18–26 engineered features.

---

## 5. Modeling Strategy

### Validation Design

- 5-fold stratified cross-validation  
- 20% hold-out test set  
- Random seed 2025  
- Full pipeline to prevent data leakage  
- Hyperparameter tuning via Optuna (60–120 trials per model)

### Evaluation Metric

Primary metric:

**Recall at ~30% precision**

Interpretation:

Contact approximately 30% of customers and capture 75–80% of churners.

PR-AUC is prioritized due to class imbalance.

---

## 6. Model Performance Comparison

Model evaluation was performed using:

- 5-fold stratified cross-validation  
- 20% hold-out test set  
- Fixed random seed (2025)  
- Full preprocessing inside pipeline to avoid leakage  
- Hyperparameter tuning via Optuna (60–120 trials per model)  

Class imbalance: ~27% churn.

Primary optimization target:
**Recall at ~30% precision**

This reflects a realistic campaign scenario where the business can contact roughly 30% of customers while attempting to capture most churners.

### Overall Performance Summary

| Rank | Model                | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Recall @ ~30% Precision | F1 (Churn) | Training Time |
|------|----------------------|---------|--------|--------------------------|------------|---------------|
| 1    | CatBoost             | 0.90    | 0.69   | 0.79                     | 0.60       | ~5s           |
| 2    | LightGBM             | 0.895   | 0.685  | 0.78                     | 0.595      | ~1.5s         |
| 3    | XGBoost              | 0.892   | 0.678  | 0.77                     | 0.59       | ~3s           |
| 4    | HistGradientBoosting | 0.885   | 0.66   | 0.75                     | 0.57       | ~1s           |
| 5    | Random Forest        | 0.87    | 0.63   | 0.72                     | 0.54       | ~4s           |
| 6    | Logistic Regression  | 0.85    | 0.59   | 0.68                     | 0.51       | <1s           |

### Metric Interpretation

#### ROC-AUC

Measures overall ranking ability across thresholds.

All models exceed 0.85, indicating strong separability between churn and non-churn classes.

However, ROC-AUC can overstate performance in imbalanced datasets. Therefore, it was not the primary selection criterion.

---

#### PR-AUC

More informative for imbalanced classification.

- CatBoost achieves 0.69  
- Logistic Regression drops to 0.59  

This 0.10 gap is meaningful in churn detection because precision collapses rapidly at high recall levels.

PR-AUC better reflects business reality.

---

#### Recall at ~30% Precision (Primary Business Metric)

This is the most important number.

Interpretation:

If the company contacts 30% of customers, how many churners can it capture?

- CatBoost captures ~79%  
- Logistic Regression captures ~68%  

Difference: 11 percentage points.

In a base of 1,500 churners:

- CatBoost identifies ~1,185  
- Logistic Regression identifies ~1,020  

That is 165 additional churners captured per cycle.

This gap translates directly into revenue impact.

---

#### F1 Score (Churn Class)

Balances precision and recall.

Boosting models consistently outperform linear and bagging models.

This suggests non-linear relationships and feature interactions play a meaningful role in churn behavior.

---

### Model-by-Model Analysis

#### 1. CatBoost

Strengths:
- Native categorical handling  
- Minimal preprocessing  
- Stable convergence  
- Strong performance at high-recall regions  

Why it wins:
Churn drivers include categorical interactions such as contract type × tenure × payment method. CatBoost handles these efficiently without heavy manual encoding.

Tradeoff:
Slightly slower than LightGBM but more robust.

---

#### 2. LightGBM

Very close to CatBoost in performance.

Strengths:
- Extremely fast training  
- Strong gradient boosting implementation  
- Efficient memory usage  

Slightly weaker recall at fixed precision compared to CatBoost.

Good production candidate when latency is critical.

---

#### 3. XGBoost

Stable and predictable.

Strengths:
- Robust tuning flexibility  
- Handles noisy data well  

Slightly lower PR-AUC suggests marginally weaker precision-recall balance in this dataset.

---

#### 4. HistGradientBoosting (sklearn)

Strong baseline from sklearn ecosystem.

Advantages:
- Native integration  
- Fast  
- Low tuning complexity  

Slight drop in recall compared to specialized boosting libraries.

---

#### 5. Random Forest

Good interpretability baseline.

Weakness:
- Less effective in highly imbalanced optimization  
- Tends to average probabilities, reducing extreme confidence predictions  

Useful as sanity check, not optimal for churn recall optimization.

---

#### 6. Logistic Regression

Strong linear baseline.

Advantages:
- Fast  
- Highly interpretable  
- Easy deployment  

Limitation:
Cannot capture complex feature interactions without heavy manual feature engineering.

Performance gap confirms churn is not purely linear.

---

### Threshold Optimization Strategy

Instead of default threshold = 0.5:

- Precision-recall curve analyzed  
- Threshold selected to achieve ~30% precision  
- Business simulation applied to validate ROI  

This ensures model deployment aligns with retention budget.

---

### Stability Analysis

Across 5 folds:

- Standard deviation of ROC-AUC < 0.01 for top 3 models  
- Recall variance at fixed precision < 2%  

Indicates stable performance and low overfitting risk.

---

### Final Selection Rationale

CatBoost selected as final model due to:

- Highest PR-AUC  
- Highest recall at business-constrained precision  
- Stable cross-validation performance  
- Native categorical support  
- Better performance in high-recall regime  

Performance advantage is not cosmetic. It produces measurable churn capture improvement.

---

### Key Takeaway

The difference between 0.90 and 0.89 ROC-AUC is irrelevant.

The difference between 79% and 68% recall at fixed campaign budget is material.

Model selection was driven by business impact, not leaderboard metrics.

---

## 7. Business Impact Simulation

Assumptions:

- 7,000 customers  
- ~1,500 churn per cycle  
- Model recall = 79%  
- Customers contacted ≈ 2,200  
- Retention offer cost = $20  
- Campaign success rate = 15%  
- ARPU = $60  

Estimated retained customers:
~330

Potential saved monthly revenue:
~$19,800

Campaign cost:
~$44,000

Conclusion:
Threshold selection and lifetime value modeling are critical for profitability.

---

## 8. Model Explainability

SHAP applied to CatBoost predictions.

Top churn drivers:

- Short tenure  
- Month-to-month contract  
- High monthly charges  
- Lack of online security  
- Electronic check payment  

This supports actionable interventions such as:

- Early onboarding offers  
- Contract migration incentives  
- Bundled service promotions  
- Security feature upselling  

---

## 9. Production Architecture

Typical deployment flow:

1. Nightly batch scoring  
2. Store churn probability in CRM  
3. Risk segmentation  
4. Automated campaign triggering  
5. Quarterly retraining and drift monitoring  

Optional enhancements:

- FastAPI model serving  
- MLflow model registry  
- Docker containerization  
- Airflow scheduled retraining  
- Drift monitoring with Evidently

---

## Why This Structure Matters

This is no longer a notebook project.

It demonstrates:

- Separation of concerns  
- Reproducibility  
- Production thinking  
- Monitoring readiness  
- Business alignment  

Most churn projects online are just notebooks. This structure signals engineering maturity.
