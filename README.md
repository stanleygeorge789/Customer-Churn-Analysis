End-to-end machine learning project focused on **understanding and predicting customer churn** in telecom, banking, SaaS, or subscription-based businesses.

## 🎯 Business Problem

> "We are losing too many customers every month and we don't know exactly why, nor who is going to leave next."

**Goal**  
Build a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn in the next 30 days with a good precision/recall trade-off → enable targeted, cost-effective retention campaigns.

## 📊 Dataset

We primarily use the classic **Telco Customer Churn** dataset (most common benchmark).
