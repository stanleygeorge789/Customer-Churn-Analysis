A business-aligned machine learning project designed to predict customer churn in telecom, SaaS, and subscription-based environments.

This is not a metric-chasing exercise. The system is optimized for constrained recall, campaign economics, and deployable architecture.

## 1. Business Context

Churn is rarely random. It is usually ignored until revenue declines become visible.

Retention is cheaper than acquisition, yet most organizations deploy blanket campaigns due to poor targeting.

**Executive question**

"Which customers are most likely to churn in the next 30 days, and how many can we realistically retain within our campaign budget?"

### Project Goal

Develop a churn prediction framework that:

- Flags high-risk customers
- Maximizes recall under fixed outreach capacity
- Quantifies expected revenue impact
- Provides interpretable drivers for action

The objective is financial impact, not cosmetic improvement in accuracy.

## 2. Dataset Overview

Primary dataset: Telco Customer Churn  

- Total records: 7,043  
- Churn rate: approximately 26.5%  

File location:
```
data/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
```

### Feature Groups

**Demographics**
- Gender  
- SeniorCitizen  
- Partner  
- Dependents  

**Service Usage**
- InternetService  
- StreamingTV  
- OnlineSecurity  
- TechSupport  

**Account Attributes**
- Tenure  
- Contract  
- MonthlyCharges  
- TotalCharges  

**Target**
- Churn (Yes / No)

Class imbalance: ~27%.

---

## 3. Key EDA Insights

- Month-to-month contracts churn 3–4× more than long-term contracts  
- Low tenure + high monthly charges is highest-risk segment  
- Lack of OnlineSecurity and TechSupport increases churn  
- Electronic check payment correlates with churn  
- Senior citizens show slightly elevated risk  

### Implications

- Stratified cross-validation required  
- Precision-Recall curves preferred over ROC  
- Threshold tuning mandatory  

Default threshold = 0.5 is financially naive.

---

## 4. Feature Engineering

Enhancements applied:

- Tenure buckets  
- Revenue-to-tenure ratio  
- Service count aggregation  
- Binary encoding for contract  
- Tenure × monthly charges interaction  
- Log transformation of skewed monetary variables  

Final feature space: ~20 engineered variables.

All preprocessing wrapped inside sklearn pipelines to prevent leakage.

## 5. Modeling Strategy

### Validation Design

- 5-fold stratified cross-validation  
- 20% hold-out test set  
- Fixed random seed (2025)  
- Optuna hyperparameter tuning (60–120 trials per model)  
- Full preprocessing inside pipeline  

### Primary Business Metric

**Recall at ~30% precision**

Interpretation:

If the company contacts 30% of customers, how many churners can it capture?

PR-AUC prioritized due to class imbalance.

## 6. Model Comparison

| Model                | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Recall @ ~30% Precision | F1 (Churn) |
|----------------------|---------|--------|--------------------------|------------|
| CatBoost             | 0.90    | 0.69   | 0.79                     | 0.60       |
| LightGBM             | 0.895   | 0.685  | 0.78                     | 0.595      |
| XGBoost              | 0.892   | 0.678  | 0.77                     | 0.59       |
| HistGradientBoosting | 0.885   | 0.66   | 0.75                     | 0.57       |
| Random Forest        | 0.87    | 0.63   | 0.72                     | 0.54       |
| Logistic Regression  | 0.85    | 0.59   | 0.68                     | 0.51       |

### What Matters

Difference between ROC 0.90 and 0.89 is noise.

Difference between 79% and 68% recall under fixed campaign budget is material.

On 1,500 churners:

- CatBoost captures ~1,185  
- Logistic Regression captures ~1,020  

That is 165 additional customers per cycle.

Model choice changes revenue.

## 7. Final Model Selection

**Selected Model: CatBoost**

Reasons:

- Highest PR-AUC  
- Strongest recall in high-recall region  
- Stable cross-validation  
- Native categorical handling  
- Minimal preprocessing  

Churn behavior is nonlinear. Boosting models outperform linear baselines.

---

## 8. Business Impact Simulation

Assumptions:

- 7,000 customers  
- 1,500 churn per cycle  
- Recall = 79%  
- 2,200 customers contacted  
- Retention cost = $20  
- Offer success rate = 15%  
- ARPU = $60  

Estimated retained customers: ~330  
Monthly revenue saved: ~$19,800  
Campaign cost: ~$44,000  

Conclusion:

Threshold tuning and lifetime value modeling determine profitability.  
Raw recall alone is insufficient.

---

## 9. Explainability

SHAP applied to CatBoost.

Top churn drivers:

- Short tenure  
- Month-to-month contract  
- High monthly charges  
- No online security  
- Electronic check payment  

These insights support targeted interventions.

## 10. Production Architecture

Typical deployment flow:

1. Nightly batch scoring  
2. Store churn probability in CRM  
3. Risk segmentation  
4. Automated campaign triggering  
5. Quarterly retraining  
6. Drift monitoring  

Optional stack:

- FastAPI  
- MLflow  
- Docker  
- Airflow  
- Evidently  

Designed for operational use, not just experimentation.
